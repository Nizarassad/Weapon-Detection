- Ensuring effective gun detection is vital in contemporary times to address escalating concerns about public safety and combat the increasing occurrences of crimes. 
- This project aims to enhance gun detection models by fine-tuning various deep learning architectures. Our key objectives are as follows:

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Achieve superior accuracy compared to existing gun detection models.
- Experiment with hyperparameter tuning to find optimal configurations.
- Focus on reducing false positive predictions while increasing precision.
- Develop a robust model that can adapt to different scenarios and perform well in various environments.

## Architectures Used
- VGG16
- YOLOv5
- YOLOv7
- YOLOv8

### âœ¨ Model Performance Comparison
In this section, we compare the performance of all four models on the test set

| Model   | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | mAP_0.5 | Test Time |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Yolov5s | 0.89      | 0.77   | 0.83     | 0.84    | 10s       |
| Yolov7  | 0.81      | 0.73   | 0.80     | 0.80    | 13s       |
| Yolov8s | 0.91      | 0.75   | 0.83     | 0.83    | 9s        |
| VGG16   | 0.86      | 0.85   | 0.82     | 0.81    | 20s       |
